Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Machine learning, a subset of AI, uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, based on neural networks with many layers, has driven breakthroughs in image and speech recognition. Quantum computing leverages quantum bits (qubits) to solve certain problems faster than classical computers, potentially revolutionizing cryptography and optimization. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. The internet of things (IoT) connects billions of devices, enabling smart homes, cities, and industries.
